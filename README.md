Principal Component analysis is an unsupervised learning algorithm. PCA is just a transformation of data that attempts to find out which 
featurs in your data expalain the most variance. Each data set has dimensons equal to the number of variables in the data set. In linear 
regression determines a line of best fit to the data set. PCA determines several orthogonal lines of best fit along n-dimensional axes. 
The first (or principal component) will explain the most variance in the data set. The next orthogonal component is chosen by the
algorithm. This component will be chosen by its ability to explain the highest amount of the remaining unexplained variance and so on. 
Many times a higher dimensional data set can have a majority of the variance accounted for with a small number of principal components. 
Thus it can be used to transform a data set of higher dimensions into much smaller dimensional space. PCA is more generally used as an 
exploratory data analysis tool rather than a full stand alone ML algorithm.
